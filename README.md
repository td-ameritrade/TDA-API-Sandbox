Welcome to the TD AMERITRADE API Support Portal (This is a collection of various projects from the API forums prior to the forum lock in 2016)

PLEASE NOTE: This site is for registered TD AMERITRADE API developers only. (Meaning that you will need an API key to connect to the API for most of the projects)

TD AMERITRADE's Application Programming Interface (API) is a protocol that TD AMERITRADE is making available to programmers - both trading application developers or individual traders who wish to integrate their software with TD AMERITRADE services for:

* Get streaming data - quotes, level II, news, actives
* Get snapshot data - quotes, news, option chains
* Get historical quote OHLC data - intraday and daily
* Get trading account information - balances, positions, transactions
* Submit/Modify/Cancel orders, including conditional orders and complex options orders

The protocol is HTTP/HTTPS based, so it is proxy-friendly and easy to code to. Trading and most snapshot data responses are XML-based, and are easily parsed.

In addition, DLL and ActiveX wrappers are provided for Windows developers. The wrappers provide easy multi-threaded and thread-safe access to the API.
